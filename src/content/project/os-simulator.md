OS-Simulator is a Java Swing-based application that simulates the behavior of an operating system, including the management of processes, CPUs, and various system settings.

> Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Java Swing**

> Features

- **Process Management**: The application allows you to simulate the creation, management, and execution of processes.
- **CPU Management**: It provides the ability to configure and manage CPUs within the system.
- **Settings**: Users can adjust various system settings such as the number of CPUs, quantum time, process size, block time, and process generation probability.
- **Visual Display**: The application offers visual representation of system components through Java Swing GUI components.

> Usage

- Upon launching the application, you will see the main window that displays various components, including Hard Drive Disk (HDD), Dispatcher, CPUs, Blocked processes, and Finished processes.
- You can interact with the application to simulate the behavior of an operating system, such as clock ticking to progress the simulation.
- You can also access settings and the Process Control Block (PCB) window to configure system settings and view detailed information about processes.
- The application provides a graphical interface for easy interaction with the operating system simulation.
